# Storage Variables with Ethers.js

This project accompanies a tutorial article posted on my Medium blog account: https://medium.com/@cryptoanarchy

The article explains storage and state on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provides coding examples to access various dynamic variables, such as strings (less than and more than 32-bytes), mappings / nested mappings, arrays / arrays of mappings, and byte-packed variables.

The excercises can be completed with the use of the deployed smart contract on the Rinkeby testnet at address: 0x (not yet deployed!)
